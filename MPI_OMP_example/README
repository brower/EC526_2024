To run  on command line.

module load gcc
module load  mvapich

mpicc  mpi_hello.cpp -o mpi_hello

mpirun -np  64  ./mpi_hello

The default here is one node with -np # treads
To allocate more than one node you need to use

//qrsh -pe mpi_12_tasks_per_node 24

qrsh -pe mpi_16_tasks_per_node 64 // full processor.

qrsh -pe mpi_8_tasks_per_node 64  // half processors

which is "-pe mpi_12_tasks_per_node"  with 24 total
(i.e 24/12 nodes) This take time to get the node so
let's not do this now.
